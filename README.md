# AssetGenerator
 a small and shitty program to generate assets when modding minecraft

## Can Generate: 
Item models

Block Models for Normal Blocks,Logs/Pillars,Plants,Anvils

BlockItem Models

BlockStates for Normal Blocks,Logs/Pillars,Plants,Anvils

Lang Files

Empty texture files (for anvils/pillars will make a top and base texture)

All of that in the right folders with the right names

## How To Use:

### 1:
Drop the content of the rar file anywhere you want

### 2:
Launch it

### 3:
 the default directory is something like C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\Asset Generator b0.1\gen 
its trash change it to either:

the folder of your source (it needs to be the folder that has the "src" subfolder in it) so that it creates the files directly where they belong
BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERWRITE YOUR FILES

or another folder so that you can make sure the files are good before copying them yourself where you need them

### 4:
actually using it after this point should be self explanatory
